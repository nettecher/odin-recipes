      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook the meat: Season the sausage and chicken 
            pieces with Cajun seasoning. Sauté the sausage 
            until browned, then remove with a slotted spoon 
            and set aside. Sauté chicken until lightly browned 
            on all sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and 
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the vegetables: In the same pot, 
            sauté the onion, celery, bell pepper, 
            and garlic until tender. Stir in the crushed 
            tomatoes and seasonings. Add the meat and cook 
            for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> Add the rice: Stir in the rice and chicken broth. 
            Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and cook until 
            all the liquid is absorbed.</li>
